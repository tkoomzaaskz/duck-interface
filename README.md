Modern Web Application
======================

This duck component is a client-side (browser) application, written mainly
in JavaScript (additionally, using lots of modern tools, such as Backbone).
It consumes a RESTful API to fetch duck data and allows end-user to access
them easily.

The interface consumes:
 * [Django API](https://github.com/wealthy-laughing-duck/duck-api-rip)
 * [static JSON files](public/data)
 * [raw PHP API communicating Java Thrift server](https://github.com/wealthy-laughing-duck/wealthy-laughing-duck)

This can be configured by changing the URL of the API (the data source).
